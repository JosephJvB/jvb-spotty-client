Spotify API Client

I've written this junk [a few times over](https://github.com/JosephJvB?tab=repositories&q=spot&type=&language=&sort=)

and I'm keen to learn about how to do npm packages again and maybe better

TODO:
- ci/cd
  - push to main creates new version
    - have to handle new version number
- tests
  - tests that check looping / chunking
  - tests that methods are creating expected fetch requests
  - tests that actually hit the spotify api - or is that bad
